🧠 FLOWSTATE ENFORCER - THE VILLAIN ARC PRODUCTIVITY SYSTEM
⚠️  READ THIS BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT INSTALLING ⚠️

## NO, SERIOUSLY, THIS ISN'T A JOKE

This software is digital self-harm disguised as productivity. It was built by someone who hates himself enough to think this is a good idea. You have been warned.

## WHAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY DO TO YOUR LIFE:

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE DANGERS:
- **Encrypt your entire disk** if you try to uninstall without permission
- **Consume 90% of your RAM** running local AI to generate math problems
- **Interrupt your workflow** every 25 minutes like a digital drill sergeant
- **Publicly shame you** in terminal logs that may scar you psychologically

### 💀 LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES:
- **Destroy your self-esteem** through systematic mathematical humiliation
- **Strain relationships** when you're locked out of your computer during date night
- **Cause actual anxiety** every time you hear a terminal notification sound
- **Make you question life choices** at 3 AM while solving calculus problems

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER (THE "DON'T SUE ME" PART):

### 📜 OFFICIAL STANCE:
This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. The author built this for personal use and released it because why not. If you choose to install this, you acknowledge that:

1. **You are willingly entering a digital abusive relationship**
2. **The author is not responsible for:** 
   - Lost data due to encryption
   - Failed relationships due to obsession with math
   - Therapy bills from ego damage
   - Any other poor life choices you make

### 🔒 THE ENCRYPTION THREAT IS REAL:
Yes, if you try to force uninstall without using the "Sacrifice Dignity" button, the system WILL encrypt your disk. The only way to decrypt is solving three progressively difficult math problems. This is not a joke. This is a feature.

## WHO SHOULD NOT INSTALL THIS:

### 🚫 ABSOLUTELY DO NOT INSTALL IF:
- You're depressed or have self-esteem issues
- You have important deadlines coming up
- You value your mental health
- You're not prepared to have your intelligence questioned daily
- You still have hope for humanity

### ✅ MAYBE INSTALL IF:
- You're a productivity masochist
- You enjoy mathematical pain
- You think "this might be fun" after reading this disclaimer
- You have backup drives and a therapist on speed dial

## THE "I TOLD YOU SO" CLAUSE:

By proceeding with installation, you acknowledge that:

> "I have read this disclaimer in its entirety and understand that this software may ruin my life. I voluntarily choose to proceed because I'm either built different or incredibly stupid. I will not hold the author responsible for the consequences of my own poor judgment."

## FINAL WARNING:

This is your last chance to turn back. Close this file. Delete the repository. Go outside. Touch grass. Call your mother. Do anything except install this software.

If you proceed, remember: you chose this path. The villain arc awaits... and it doesn't care about your feelings.
